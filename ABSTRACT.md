The **STARE: Structured Analysis of the Retina Dataset** concerns a system to automatically diagnose diseases of the human eye. It was conceived and initiated in 1975. During its history, over thirty people contributed to the project, with backgrounds ranging from medicine to science to engineering. Images and clinical data were provided by the Shiley Eye Center at the University of California, San Diego, and by the Veterans Administration Medical Center in San Diego.

## Dataset description

An ophthalmologist, a specialized medical doctor, focuses on the examination, structure, function, and ailments of the human eye. During clinical evaluations, an ophthalmologist observes various ocular characteristics, which serve as vital indicators of the subject's ocular health. For example, changes such as optic nerve discoloration or retinal blood vessel narrowing can prompt diagnoses like Coats' disease or central retinal artery occlusion.

Retinal imaging is a common procedure during examinations, wherein an optical camera captures images of the inner rear surface of the eyeball through the pupil. These images depict crucial structures such as the optic nerve, fovea, surrounding vessels, and retinal layers, aiding ophthalmologists in diagnosis and treatment planning. In a similar vein, the system under discussion analyzes retinal images, mimicking the observations made by ophthalmologists during clinical examinations. Its primary output is a diagnosis reflecting the conclusions an ophthalmologist would draw regarding the subject's ocular health.

The approach devised by the authors divides the problem into two key components. Firstly, it automatically processes retinal images to identify significant findings. Secondly, it automatically interprets these findings to formulate a diagnosis. Additionally, the system provides detailed measurements of anatomical structures and lesions visible in the retinal images. These measurements are invaluable for tracking disease progression and evaluating treatment efficacy over time. By amassing a database of measurements from a diverse population, the STARE project facilitates clinical population studies and enhances intern training in ophthalmology.
