**STARE: Structured Analysis of the Retina Dataset** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the medical research. 

The dataset consists of 397 images with 60 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*vessels*).

Images in the STARE dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 377 (95% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 3 labelers: ***adam hoover*** (20 objects), ***filter probing algorithm*** (20 objects), and ***valentina kouznetsova*** (20 objects). Additionally, every image contains information about patient ***diagnos***. Explore it in supervisely labeling tool. The dataset was released in 2000 by the University of California, USA.
